      <p>Hi, I'm Merve Dilara Özdemir. First, thank you for considering me. I have always loved design, art, solving complex problems and mathematics. That is why I chose architecture for my university degree. But, while I was studying, I realised something was missing and that this path wasn't right for me. I wanted a more dynamic and fast-paced working environment where I could study human interactions and learn entirely new concepts. So, after my graduation, I looked for what could be an ideal career for me, which turned out to be UX Design. It was perfect: everything architecture wasn't while also having the best aspects of architecture -designing and analysing human interactions-. I have decided to learn UX Design and be as good at it as possible. I have completed the Google Course for UX Design and then started working on my portfolio and doing projects in very diverse fields. I wanted to learn and be experienced in as many aspects of UX Design as possible. I also learned HTML and CSS while working on my portfolio. I've coded this website myself!

    <div class="box5">
      <p>Now, I'm ready to showcase what I have done to you. You can be sure that I'm a fast learner, eager to work and a great problem solver. I can think very analytically and come up with multiple solutions in a short period. I can also say that I can be very empathetic, it is easy for me to put myself in other people's shoes, and understand what other people are feeling. I do very well in collaborative environments where I can work with other people towards a common goal while also being content with working by myself. Hope to work with you soon. Have a lovely day!
