              <p>Current POS softwares on the market are not thorough enough to meet all work requirements, employees usually need more than one platform for their work. Many of them are outdated and difficult to use. </p>

            <div class="data22">
              <h4>Goal</h4>
              <p>To design a POS Software that every employee and manager could use while making it easier for them to communicate with each other. Gathering all required processes of retail and cafe work into one system, leaving no need for other softwares or websites.</p>

      <section id="research">
        <h1>Research</h1>
        <p>I have interviewed multiple retail stores and coffee shops (employees and managers) and asked them general questions about their experiences with POS systems. I have avoided restaurants because initial basic research before the interviews showed that they required a very different software structure than the other two, which were pretty similar. 
        <br><br>
        Here are some of the questions I've asked during the interviews:
        <br><br>
        </p>
        <p id="leftquestions"> "What feature(s) would you like to see in a new POS software?"</p>
        <p id="rightquestions"> "What other technologies and programs are you using alongside the POS, and can you explain their functions?"</p>
        <p id="leftquestions"> "What are your favourite features of POS systems and other programs you have used?"</p>
        <p id="rightquestions"> "What are some of the common problems you have encountered with POS softwares you have been using?"</p>
        <h2>Personas</h2>
        <p>In both coffee shops and the stores, employees had similar wishes and problems. Meanwhile, managers' issues were similar to each other but different from their employees. That is why I have divided personas into two categories, employees and managers.</p>
        <img class="persona" src="pointouch/personas.png"> 
        <h2>User Journey Map</h2>
        <p>The user journey map of both coffee and retail shop employees combined. Day-to-day includes lots of small and some big tasks that, when added up, do have a tendency to mentally drain a person. Something that could be done about this is to have daily routine and singular occurrence lists, among other things that are shown here.</p>
        <img class="ujm" loading="lazy" src="pointouch/userjm.png"> 
        <h2>Competitive Audit</h2>
        <p>Since these types of software are paid software for specific purposes, it was hard to find good quality free versions. So, I've downloaded the trial versions for the competitive audit or used their online demo versions. I've also looked through the comments, criticisms and good remarks that were made about the software. </p>

      </section>
    
      <section id="ideation">
        <h1>Ideation</h1>
        <p>Based on the information gathered by the research, some ideas have started to form such as what features that people mainly wanted, what to incorporate or stay away from or what can be done to solve some common problems. So, I have taken notes of these ideas started to work upon them.</p>
        <h2>Sitemap</h2>
        <p>The structure of the app is hierarchical. From the homepage, it has been divided into six branches of the main menu (accounts, payment, applications, investing, budget, profile) and 'search' and 'help' sections.</p>
        <img class="ujm" loading="lazy" src="pointouch/sitemap.png"> 
        <h2>User Flow</h2>
        <p>Here are the user flows for the opening shift and the checkout process in <span style="color: #b04e30;">brown</span>, the closing shift in <span style="color: #7645c6;">purple</span>, and the manager's process in <span style="color: #58c39a;">teal</span>. The user flow is the same for both the retail store employees and coffee shop employees. The user flow for the coffee shop employee was made based on the assumption that the coffee shop would be functioning as a takeout or a self-serve coffee shop, where workers would be behind the counter. It would be a whole other project (with a very different user flow) to make a POS software for places where servers are involved, like restaurants, so it was avoided.</p>
        <img class="ujm" loading="lazy" src="pointouch/userflow.png"> 
        <h2>Crazy Eights</h2>        
        <p>There were several features that I wanted to incorporate into the design or avoid while doing the crazy eights exercise. Some of them were: <span style="text-decoration: underline dotted">Customizable homepage, detailed and categorized expenses page, icons and explanatory buttons, simple design that is detailed enough, most used functions on the homepage, visible search bar, timetables, notification and scheduling options, etc. </span></p>

      <section id="lowfidelity">
        <h1>Low Fidelity Design</h1>
        <p>Slowly, from the products of the ideation process, the app's outlines have started to form. To make the ideas and concepts morph into physical forms in the best way possible, I've tried many alternative designs starting from sketching.</p>
        <h2>Sketches</h2>
        <p>I've combined the best features from the crazy eights exercise into complete sketches on paper. I believe using pen and paper while designing fuels creativity.</p>
        <img class="ujm" loading="lazy" src="pointouch/sketches.png"> 
        <h2>Wireframes</h2>
        <p>Then, I've turned those paper sketches into digital wireframes. I've also added more digital wireframes to the design so that there were enough wireframes to complete multiple userflows.Below, are some of the main wireframes of the design.</p>

        <h1>High Fidelity Design</h1>
        <p>I have had conversations with people who wanted to do something good for the environment but didn’t know where to start or what to do. Then, I interviewed these people to gather more insight. I also conducted interviews with people who are interested in investments. The primary user group was people who cared about their community and environmentalists. Here's some of the questions I've asked: <br>
