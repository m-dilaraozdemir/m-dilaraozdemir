        <h1>Research</h1>
        <p>I have spoken to people around me who prefers to use or not to use banking apps and interviewed them. I especially chose people whose banks have a similar concept as the cadence Bank. For most people these apps were too complicated and intimidating.
        <br><br>
        Here are some of the questions I've asked during the interviews:
        <br><br>
        </p>
        <p id="leftquestions"> "Do you regulary use a banking app? Please explain why or why not."</p>
        <p id="rightquestions"> "What features do you use more often or like more?"</p>
        <p id="leftquestions"> "What feature would you like to see added, if any?"</p>
        <p id="rightquestions"> "What are your complaints with your current banking app?"</p>
        <h2>Personas</h2>
        <p>People I have had conversations with had some common problems and goals. So I have fused their opinions into two different personas, summarizing all the input.</p>
        <img class="persona" src="cadence/personas.png"> 
        <h2>User Journey Map</h2>
        <p>Here is the user journey map for Claire. She starts the journey in a fairly neutral mood and leaves the app in a bad mood therefore associating the app with bad feelings.</p>
        <img class="ujm" loading="lazy" src="cadence/userjm.png"> 
        <h2>Competitive Audit</h2>
        <p>Then, I have looked into other banking apps with similar concepts as ours. I've gathered data and sorted them into two groups which are positive and negative qualities. I have also taken into consideration the comments about the apps in the AppStore. </p>
        <img class="ujm" loading="lazy" src="cadence/compet.png"> 
      </section>
    
      <section id="ideation">
        <h1>Ideation</h1>
        <p>Based on the information gathered by the research, some ideas have started to form such as what features that people mainly wanted, what to incorporate or stay away from or what can be done to solve some common problems. So, I have taken notes of these ideas started to work upon them.</p>
        <h2>Sitemap</h2>
        <p>The structure of the app is hierarchical. From the homepage, it has been divided into six branches of the main menu (accounts, payment, applications, investing, budget, profile) and 'search' and 'help' sections.</p>
        <img class="ujm" loading="lazy" src="cadence/sitemap.png"> 
        <h2>User Flow</h2>
        <p>Here, user flows for both investing in stocks and setting a budget goal are shown. Investing flow is drawn in <span style="color: #24ABF6;">blue</span> while budgeting flow is drawn in <span style="color: #B752B7;">purple</span>.</p>
        <img class="ujm" loading="lazy" src="cadence/userflow.png"> 
        <h2>Crazy Eights</h2>        
        <p>There were several features that I wanted to incorporate into the design or avoid while doing the crazy eights exercise. Some of them were: <span style="text-decoration: underline dotted">Customizable homepage, detailed and categorized expenses page, icons and explanatory buttons, simple design that is detailed enough, most used functions on the homepage, visible search bar, timetables, notification and scheduling options, etc. </span></p>

      <section id="lowfidelity">
        <h1>Low Fidelity Design</h1>
        <p>Slowly, from the products of the ideation process, the app's outlines have started to form. To make the ideas and concepts morph into physical forms in the best way possible, I've tried many alternative designs starting from sketching.</p>
        <h2>Sketches</h2>
        <p>I've combined the best features from the crazy eights exercise into complete sketches on paper. I believe using pen and paper while designing fuels creativity.</p>
        <img class="ujm" loading="lazy" src="cadence/sketches.jpg"> 
        <h2>Wireframes</h2>
        <p>Then, I've turned those paper sketches into digital wireframes. I've also added more digital wireframes to the design so that there were enough wireframes to complete multiple userflows.Below, are some of the main wireframes of the design.</p>
        <img class="wire" src="cadence/Wireframes.png">
        <h2>Low Fidelity Prototype</h2>">
        <p> The final prototype before the usability study. Multiple wireframes were connected to make userflows and those userflows were connected to make one complete prototype.</p>

      <section id="testing">
        <h1>Testing</h1>
        <p>Next, it was time to test the low fidelity prototype.</p>
        <h2>Usability Study</h2>
        <img class="ujm" loading="lazy" src="cadence/usabilitystudy.png"> 
        <h2>Changes</h2>
        <p>I've done changes on the wireframes based on the outcome of the usability study. The themes and their insights were the main factors for the changes.</p>

        <h1>High Fidelity Design</h1>
        <p>I have had conversations with people who wanted to do something good for the environment but didnâ€™t know where to start or what to do. Then, I interviewed these people to gather more insight. I also conducted interviews with people who are interested in investments. The primary user group was people who cared about their community and environmentalists. Here's some of the questions I've asked: <br>
        "What would you like to see</p>
